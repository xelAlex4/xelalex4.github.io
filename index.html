                <h2>Hi, I'm Alex! <br>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h2>
                <p class="lead">I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Rutgers University-New Brunswick, passionate about building scalable applications and integrating AI solutions into software development.</p> <br>
                <p>My academic journey was defined by a deep curiosity for how systems work, ranging from the intricacies of database normalization and networking protocols to the implementation of advanced AI algorithms like Hidden Markov Models and Naive Bayes classifiers.</p> <br>
                <p>Professionally, I specialize in full-stack development and DevOps, with a track record of engineering robust solutions for NYC government agencies. As a Platform Developer Intern at the NYC Administration for Children's Services, I led the modernization of legacy workflows by digitizing complex forms and migrating over 400 repositories to Azure DevOps. My experience also extends to data infrastructure; at the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services, I executed large-scale data migrations and configured CI/CD pipelines to ensure stable software deployments.</p><br>
                <p>Beyond traditional software engineering, I have a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence and its practical applications. My work as an AI Coding Consultant involved stress-testing Large Language Models to reduce hallucinations and optimize code generation. I have applied this interest to my own projects as well, such as developing a Natural Language-to-SQL agent that allows users to query databases using plain English.</p><br>
                <p>I am driven by the challenge of building scalable, user-centric software. Whether I am architecting backend automation using the Microsoft Power Platform or optimizing mobile interfaces for Android, my goal is to create innovative tools that solve real-world problems. I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my technical skills in a challenging application developer or analyst role.</p>
