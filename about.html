                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Alex Lee, a passionate Computer Science student and software developer based in Brooklyn, New York. My journey into computer science began in middle school when I joined my school's robotics club. That experience ignited a deep curiosity about coding and problem-solving, and from that point on, I’ve been hooked. <br /> <br />
                    Over the years, I’ve grown to appreciate how technology can shape the world around us, and I’m driven by the idea of creating innovative solutions that improve people’s everyday lives. Whether it's through building intuitive software or solving complex challenges, I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and make an impact. <br /> <br />
                    I’m most proficient in Java and Python, but I’ve also worked with C, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS in past projects. I also have professional experience with low-code development in Power Apps, Power Automate, Model-Driven Apps, Dynamics 365, Power BI, and Sharepoint. <br /> <br />
                    I thrive in environments where creativity meets technical problem-solving, and I’m excited about contributing my skills to projects that make a real difference. </p>

                                Interning as a Data Administrator at the Office of Assemblymember Grace Lee was my first real experience working in a professional environment, and it quickly showed me how much weight my actions could carry.
                                She was the Assemblymember responsible for District 65, which covered all of Manhattan’s Lower East Side and Financial District—a huge and diverse community with countless people relying on us for support. <br><br>
                                Every piece of data I managed, every report I worked on, and every task I handled had real consequences, impacting decisions that affected thousands of people.
                                It was both exciting and humbling to know that my work wasn’t just busywork—it mattered. <br><br>
                                This experience helped me develop a strong attention to detail, improve my organizational skills, and understand the importance of accuracy when dealing with large-scale administrative work. 
                                Most importantly, it gave me a firsthand experience into how data plays a crucial role in serving a community.<br><br>

                                Being a teaching assistant made me realize how much I enjoy helping others. 
                                Working with kids, I got to see firsthand how my actions could have a real impact—whether it was explaining a tricky concept, guiding them through an assignment, or just being there to support them. 
                                It was rewarding to watch them gain confidence and improve over time, knowing I played a small part in that growth. <br><br>
                                The experience also taught me how to be patient, adapt my communication style, and find different ways to explain things so they truly understood. 
                                Seeing their progress made me appreciate the power of teaching, and it’s one of the reasons I want to continue helping people learn and grow in the future. <br><br>

                                Working as a waiter taught me a lot about teamwork and how important it is to communicate and coordinate with others to keep things running smoothly. 
                                Every day, I had to work closely with the kitchen staff and other servers to make sure orders came out right and customers were happy. <br><br>
                                It also taught me a lot about patience—whether it was dealing with difficult customers, handling last-minute requests, or juggling multiple tables at once. <br><br>
                                There’s nothing more stressful than a packed restaurant during a dinner rush, but learning to stay calm and focused in those high-pressure moments was invaluable. 
                                It pushed me to think on my feet, manage my time wisely, and solve problems quickly, all while keeping a smile on my face!
